Java file: MoneyCalculator
Files required:
  MoneyCalculator.java


  The purpose of this file was to practice math functions and trying to find a practical use for them. In this case,
  I needed to caclulate a budget for my family so we could see what kind of house we can afford. I incorporated a
  mortgage calculator which will accurately determine what the monthly payment will look like depending on the mortgage
  size and interest rate.
  
  The program, when run, first asks the user, which in this case was myself, to make sure information about my wage and 
  car insurance is up to date. After going through my information, it then prompts the user to provide the information
  for the spouse. After asking about our savings, having gotten the required information, it will then calculate the 
  maximum earnings by month, how much is spent per month, how long it will take to save for a down payment, what the
  mortgage rate is, and what will be left over for savings after paying bills, mortgage, and utilities
  
To run:
